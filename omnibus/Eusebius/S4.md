#Session 4

##What is Canonical?

Definitions: 

Canon: Group of books acknowledges by the church as scripture
Apocrypha: 14 books not accepted by Protestants
Pseudepigrapha: spurious writings attributed to prophets, allegedly written in Biblical times, but not accepted as Canonical.

There is a large distinction between scripture and spurious works.

Tests to determine if somethings is Canonical:

- Aposticality
- Acceptance
- Content
- Inspiration

##Can we be sure that the Word of God is true?

Jewish People know what a Canon looks like. They have old Testament and its natural for them to write it down. Also, Jesus promised to guide the church. He does this through his word. Therefore, he has given us documents to accomplish this.

It has been God's Plan to bring the Bible together. There are some variations between texts, but these don't affect Biblical teaching. They are merely grammatical.
